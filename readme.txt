# Syntax-based Contextual Visualizations for SAE & LLM Interpretability
## Project Overview
This project aims to improve the interpretability of large language models (LLMs) by developing a new visualization method for Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) feature contexts. 
We propose replacing linear text-based activation contexts with probabilistic syntactic trees.
