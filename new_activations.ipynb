    "This notebook downloads a small piece of a text dataset to local cache (`/Users/USER/.cache/huggingface/datasets` on macbook). Then, you should manually install the files (which are dicts for activations and locations for each feature) from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/MrGonao/raw_features_gemma16/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MrGonao/raw_features_gemma16/tree/main) to the features folder. After doing this, the code below will find you the activating documents for each feature. "
