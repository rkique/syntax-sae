The section regarding beliefs on military spending attempts to paint the Democratic party as more anti-war and pro-veteran with Republicans supporting more military intervention and bare minimum aid for those who served. Despite the so called anti-war left becoming nearly non-existent as President Obama expands his drone program and foreign entanglements, the reality of the Republican and Democrat leadership’s continued support of groups who kill our soldiers, while ignoring our veterans perils at home, is unsurprisingly absent.\\nMany parents not only found the assignment highly inappropriate, but question if the assignment was an attempt to gauge families’ political affiliations given the fact that many sixth graders would likely repeat what they heard at home, not having a true personal understanding of the listed topics.

The statement from Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf bin Abdulaziz, the Saudi ambassador to London, came as talks between Iran and the P5+1 group of world powers were in full swing in Geneva.

It could now make that point more forcefully, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintaining that the nuclear deal endangers Israel’s security. The nuclear deal has also strained Israel-U.S. ties and might make it more difficult for Washington to exert pressure on Israel on the Palestinian issue, should it decide to do so. Palestinian negotiators on Sunday praised the nuclear deal as a precedent in which the international community came together to solve a difficult issue. They said the major powers should do the same to try to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has festered for decades.

Their devotion to their families, their farms, and their way of life are second only to their devotion to God.

They value simplicity and self-denial over comfort, convenience, and leisure.Their belief system is even evident in how they dress. Their plain clothing represents humility and separation.

By the time you and your children finish your research on the Amish, your curiosity about this unique religious group may be satisfied. Then again, you may have more questions. Regardless of the outcome, have fun.Who Are the Amish?The Amish church began as part of the Anabaptist movement in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Anabaptists rejected the doctrine of infant baptism, believing instead that only adults who had confessed a personal belief in Jesus as Savior should be baptized. They also did not believe in war and tried to live peaceably with their neighbors. Because of these beliefs, they were severely persecuted by both Protestants and Catholics.In 1693 a group of Mennonites led by Jacob Amman broke away over issues of doctrine, primarily the use of shunning (excommunication, including avoidance of all social interaction). The Amish practice shunning, based on their understanding of passages such as 1 Corinthians 5. The group led by Amman fled to Switzerland and southern Germany, where they became farmers and began',\n",
       " ' having services in their homes. Eventually they heard of William Penn’s colony in the New World and his promise of religious freedom. Many left Europe and settled in what would become Pennsylvania.What They BelieveThe Amish are devout in their faith, believing in the literal interpretation and application of Scripture. Their devotion to their families, their farms, and their way of life are second only to their devotion to God. They believe separation from the things of the world is not only commanded by God but also strengthens their relationship to God. After all, the things of the world can be distractions. They value simplicity and self-denial over comfort, convenience, and leisure.Their belief system is even evident in how they dress. Their plain clothing represents humility and separation. Men do not grow mustaches because they associate them with military service.One of the ways the Amish literally interpret Scripture is their interpretation of the Second Commandment: Thou shalt not make any graven images. They will not allow their photographs to be taken (although some tourists and reporters do so secretly). For this reason, Amish dolls do not have faces.They believe that church membership is a choice every young adult should make with full knowledge of what he or she will be giving up if he or she',\n",

When I listened to it, I was horrified to think that people would see that and think of me.\\nOkay, ‘horrified’ is too strong a word. I was stricken with the need to clarify where I would disagree with these 10 commandments and, in fact, why I would be disinclined to write a set of commandments to start with.\\nOn the issue of having commandments at all, I have often compared atheism to heleocentrism (the view that the sun, rather than the earth, is at the center of the solar system) in that neither has anything substantive to say about morality. To understand morality, you have to look someplace other than the orbit of the Earth around the sun, and you have to look at what does exist rather than at what does not exist. The only implication that atheism has for morality is\",\n",

For example, I am fond of saying, “The only legitimate response to words are words and private actions; the only legitimate response to a political campaign in an open society is a counter-campaign.”\\nHowever, I hold these up as rules of thumb, not as commandments. In the words of the famed pirate Barbosa from Pirates of the Caribbean, these are... more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.\\nBy ‘guidelines’ I do not mean that they can be broken on a whim. I mean that they are simplistic approximations of moral truth that are useful in a lot of common situations, but they are not literally true.\\nThe free speech slogan above, for example, says nothing about libel and slander, or of fraud (which basically is a crime using words – lies – to manipulate the actions of others), revealing private information, (e.g., publishing somebody’s credit report online), or violating national security (printing or publishing the plans for the Allied assault on Normandy in 1944).\\n\",\n",

It’s unclear what effect the precedent of successful nuclear negotiations will have on Syria’s civil war and on efforts to broker a political resolution to the conflict. The West acknowledges that Iran is a major player in Syria, but the U.S. and the Syrian rebels remain opposed to Tehran taking part in a proposed peace conference that Washington and Russia are trying to convene. Assad ally Russia, meanwhile, wants Iran at the negotiating table. It may all be a moot point, since it’s unclear whether the peace talks will even take place. Assad’s government and the rebels disagree on the ground rules.\\nIRAQ - Iran and the United States have considerable influence over Shiite and Sunni political groups, respectively, in Iraq.

       " \" any other al-Qaida affiliate, has always thought big. SAM RASOFF: Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula doesn't confine its recruitment to Yemen and certainly doesn't confine its operational vision to the Arabian Peninsula. They're an organization with an increasingly global recruitment platform and global ambitions for where they are going to strike. TEMPLE-RASTON: Al-Qaida's leaders have had an eye on Nigeria for years. Osama bin Laden himself singled out Nigeria as fertile ground for terrorist recruitment back in 2003. U.S. officials found correspondence between bin Laden and leaders of Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgent group, in the compound where bin Laden was killed. And of course, the famous Underwear Bomber of 2009 was a Nigerian man. This new court case may be the latest indication that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula sees Nigeria as good ground for recruiting - though the group may have some competition from another al-Qaida arm, this one in Africa.

HAM: Most notably I would say the linkages between al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram are probably the most worrisome, in terms of the indications we have that they are likely sharing funds, training, and explosive materials which can be quite dangerous. TEMPLE-RASTON: So there are two different terrorist connections to Nigeria, one from the al-Qaida group in North Africa and now one from the al-Qaida group in Yemen. London terrorism expert Peter Neumann says that could be dangerous, not just for Nigeria, but potentially for the West as well. NEUMANN: So far, really it is a local Nigerian conflict. The influence of al-Qaida could turn this into a sort of global confrontation between the West and Islam, as they see it. TEMPLE-RASTON: Al-Qaida has done this before. It offers money and training and recruits to local groups. And in exchange, those groups swear allegiance and join the fight against the West. Counter-terrorism officials are monitoring whether al-Qaida will be able to reprise that scenario in Nigeria. Dina Temple-Raston, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MON',\n",

The latter, an unidentified assistant to Filippino, has been dubbed the Master of Memphis after a work in the collection of the Brooks Museum of Art, Memphis, Tennessee. His paintings can be identified by the characteristically long and slender fingers and toes of his figures, their rather abrupt gestures and voluminous drapery, with numerous folds and pleats, all of which are evident in this work. This tondo is similar to works attributed to Filippino himself, and thus also demonstrates the influence of Fra Filippo Lippi and Botticelli. There is a particular, obvious delight in the details of the landscape in the background, the tiny plants and grasses in the foreground as well as the hazy blue mountains and towers of the town in the distance that is typical of Filippino.\\nAstronomy was a science associated in antiquity with Urania, one of the nine Muses whose task it was \\x91to measure the heavens and consider the measurements of their movements\\x92.',\n",
